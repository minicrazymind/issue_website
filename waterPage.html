        <p>The Water Tribe is a collective term for the nation of people who practice the art of waterbending. It is one of the original four nations and its citizens primarily inhabit the northern and southernmost regions of the globe, near both
          poles. The people of the Water Tribe are generally peaceful, and strive to live in harmony with nature and the other nations of the world. There are two primary divisions of the Water Tribe, the Northern Tribe and the Southern Tribe, though
          both were at least de jure governed by the Northern chief until 171 AG.</p>

          Although in the past there was significant exchange between the North and South, contact between the two tribes was interrupted due to the chaos of the Hundred Year War. Though communication resumed afterward, tensions remained between the
          tribes.The Water Tribe is less powerful than both the Earth Kingdom and the Fire Nation, due to its geographical location and the small size of its population and economy. The economy is dependent on the ocean, given the country's location
          and lack of arable land, apparent manufacturing capacity or minable resources.</p>

          The Water Tribe joined a global conflict known as the Hundred Year War against the Fire Nation during the life of Avatar Aang. The Southern Tribe was driven to the brink of extinction through a series of devastating raids, and the Northern
          Tribe proved unable to provide any resources for the War beyond its borders. The appearance of the Water Tribe is based on its corresponding element, water. Each of the nations has its own elemental color, which in the case of the Water
          Tribes is blue. The Foggy Swamp Tribe is an exception, as they tend to wear green due to their affinity with plants.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Water Tribe is divided into three distinct groups, primarily based on their geography and affinity for waterbending. The Southern Tribe occupies the South Pole with Katara as its only known bending member during the War,[6] the art
          having been almost completely erased from the South Pole as a direct result of the Fire Nation raids.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Northern Tribe consists of the majority of the official remnants of their civilization, occupying the North Pole with a multitude of able benders. Though separated, the Southern and Northern Tribes continued to remain in contact prior
          to the Hundred Year War and at one time even retained a custom of coming together during a new moon justly called the New Moon Celebration. The Foggy Swamp Tribe occupies a swamp in the Earth Kingdom, while most, if not all, of its members
          are competent benders with some unique talents, such as plantbending.
        </p>

        <p>
          Despite having some patriarchal inclination, the Water Tribe has a long history of acceptance regarding same-sex relationships. They believe that one's personal life is theirs to divulge and no one else's.
